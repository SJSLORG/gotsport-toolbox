# ARBITER INCONSISTENCIES

Discovered a bunch of EDP games and that the Arbiter Sync is not updating RESCHEDULE or other games.

## ANALYSIS

1. Compare GameID in GS to Arbiter irrespective of GAME DATE
   1. if in GS and Arbiter, it is synced
   1. if in Arbiter and not GS - find, list - possible EDP
   1. if in GS and not in Arbiter
